# CNN_prob
In this model I had used the sequential model from keras.
This model use application of Convolutional neural network to solve the classification problem of Cat vs Dog.
You can download the data-set from the link : "https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data".
Model and trained weights are saved in model.json and model.h5 files.
The code to retrieve the trained weight and present in the notebook.
